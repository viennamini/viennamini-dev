The models for different quantities go in here. Currently mostly trivial stuff (i.e. constants).
In the long run, this should be only an interface to ViennaModels.
However, first we need to get the simulator running before more work on ViennaMaterials/ViennaModels makes sense.
Also, time will show which interface for ViennaMaterials <-> ViennaModels is best.
Will require a few iterations (aka. refinements/reimplementations).
